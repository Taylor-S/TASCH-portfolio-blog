                <p>In 2020, I partnered with a friend to develop OnTrackChat, a student well-being app aimed at
                    improving student engagement and accountability in primary schools. Utilising AWS, I was able to
                    create a minimum viable product (MVP) using Angular and PWA technology.</p>

                <h2>The Approach</h2>
                <p>As a small team we would meet on weekends to brainstorm potential solutions to the challenge of
                    “improving student engagement and self-accountability” in primary schools. Our sessions followed a
                    structured process:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We created an agenda for each meeting to ensure we stayed focused on our goals and recorded any
                        tangential ideas on a Trello board for later consideration.
                    </li>
                    <li>Each team member had 5 minutes to sketch their idea for addressing the agenda items.</li>
                    <li>We compared and rated the ideas and repeated the process until we arrived at a combination of
                        everyone's ideas.</li>
                    <li>We created a rough sketch based on the chosen ideas and conducted user testing to gather
                        feedback and make revisions.</li>
                    <li>The sketch was then digitized and styled, and further tested before being developed into a
                        functional web application.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p class="bold pt-0-5">First time building an application as the sole developer</p>
                <p>As a full stack developer with several years of experience, I had previously always worked on
                    applications as part of a team. This project presented a new challenge as it was my first time
                    building a larger application solo and architecting the entire app. Initially, the app's
                    architecture included hosting on a virtual private server (VPS) and deploying our code using a
                    continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline created with GitHub Actions. The
                    backend application, built with Node.js, connected to a MongoDB database and handled authentication
                    and other tasks. The frontend Angular application communicated with the Node.js application.</p>


                <p class="bold pt-0-5">A change in plans</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, I (TASCH) ended up taking full ownership of
                    OnTrackChat and
                    had to migrate the application to my own resources. Rather than maintaining a server, I chose to
                    move
                    the application to AWS Amplify, a platform that was new to me. This involved learning about
                    serverless applications and GraphQL, which presented additional learning curves. Despite these
                    challenges, I was able to successfully migrate the app and continue development.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The app is currently being refined and enhanced based on user feedback. Despite facing many challenges,
                the MVP has been successfully launched and is being utilized to promote student engagement and
                self-accountability. This project was a valuable learning experience and has given me the skills and
                confidence to tackle similar projects in the future.</p>
