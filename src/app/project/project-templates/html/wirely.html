            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>In April 2022, I teamed up with Wirely to develop a progressive web application using Angular 9+. As the
                project progressed, we upgraded to Angular 13. Initially, the app displayed high-level metrics to
                clients on a dashboard. We then added new features, such as displaying weather information for specific
                venues and adapting an existing desktop feature for mobile devices.</p>

            <h2>The Approach</h2>
            <p>Before I wrote any code, I always began by brainstorming and sketching out my design in my sketchbook.
                Once I was satisfied with my rough sketch, I would then create a digital mock-up to show to Wirely. This
                approach had several benefits:
            </p>
            <ol class="pt-1 pl-2-5">
                <li>It allowed me to test the usability of the feature through user testing.</li>
                <li>It ensured that the feature being developed met Wirely's needs and requirements.</li>
                <li>Making changes to a mock-up was much more efficient and cost-effective than modifying code later on.
                </li>
                <li>It facilitated the iteration of designs to better fit the needs of the end user.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p class="bold pt-0-5">Getting up to speed with NestJS</p>
            <p>
                Up until this point, I had not had the opportunity to work with NestJS as a backend framework. However,
                I was pleasantly surprised by how well-documented and user-friendly it was. Despite being new to it, I
                was able to quickly get the hang of it and begin using it effectively in my work. Overall, I found
                NestJS to be a great tool for building scalable, modular server-side applications.
            </p>
            <p class="bold pt-0-5">Converting a desktop feature to mobile</p>
            <p>
                Wirely's desktop application had a widely used Petty Cash feature, and the idea was to allow users to
                log petty cash transactions on their phones in real-time. The main challenge I faced was how to
                effectively present all the relevant information on the small screen of a mobile device. I had to be
                strategic in my design and layout choices to ensure that the feature was easy to use and understand on a
                mobile device. Despite the challenge, I was able to successfully adapt the feature for mobile users.
            </p>
            <img class="pt-1 pb-1" src="../../../../assets/images/Wirely_Tile_desktop.png" alt="Overview image">
            <p>
                To overcome this, I replaced the original table display with an expandable version that only showed the
                most essential information. When necessary, users could expand the display to see more details. They
                could also easily add a new transaction by pressing the plus button in the bottom right corner of the
                screen. I conducted user testing within Wirely to confirm that the redesigned feature was easy to use
                and intuitive. Overall, I was able to successfully adapt the Petty Cash feature for mobile devices while
                maintaining its core functionality.

            <h2>Other Services Provided</h2>
            <p>
                Wirely reached out to me to integrate a third-party service into their backend application for a new
                client. To accomplish this task, I created automated jobs that interacted with the third party's API to
                retrieve data. This data was then stored within Wirely's system and used to generate reports for the
                client. Overall, the integration of this third party was successful and allowed Wirely to provide their
                client with the data they needed.
